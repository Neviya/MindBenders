## INFM 600 Analysis of Google Playstore Apps
#### Objective 
The purpose of our project is to gather and analyze detailed information on various apps on Google Play Store. With the kaggle dataset of over 10,000 records of distinct applications on the Google Play Store, we plan to generate meaningful insights that can be used by the developers and marketers to ensure that their application succeeds and doesn’t get lost in the shuffle. The questions this data might help to answer are as follows:

1.	We can visualize the most installed categories for the app. 
2.	What are the top ‘10’ genres of the most installed app.
3.	What are the top apps in the paid category
4.	Best Apps in App store
5.	Predict the number of installs of the upcoming apps depending on the category, genre and android version supported.
